<b><li>Primary School</li></b>
<br>

<br>
<b><li>Secondary School</li></b>
<br>
<p align="left">After that, I continue my education for 5 years at <abbr title="Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Taman Hi-Tech">SMKTHT</abbr>. This school is located at Jalan KTC 5, Kulim Hi-Tech Park. In this school, I managed to get a lot of 
friends that still keep in touch with me until today. Im glad that they are always be there with me till now. I have a lot of experience while going to this school and the teachers in this school also giving me a lot of chances to keep exploring
my teenangers life.</p>
<p align="left"> To give an example, my teacher gave me an opportunity to become one of the peers for the first batch of my school. I was so excited since she choose my close friend and I to become peers of my school. I also attended a lot of events
that held specially for peers members of Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Taman Hi-Tech (SMKTHT).</p>
<p align="left"> These are some of the memories that my friends and I have captured throughout secondary school. </p>

<br>
<b><li>University</li></b>
<br>
<p align="left">After finished my secondary school journey, I decided to continue my study at UiTM Kedah, in major of Diploma in Information Management. This semester will be my last semester in this university. This university is located at Merbok,Sungai Petani,Kedah. The reason
why I choose this university is because this university is kind of near to my house, which is Kulim, compared to the other UiTM in Malaysia. In this university, I also get to know a lot of people that now has become my friends for almost 3 years, from 2019 till 2021.
