<p>On 28-30 October 2020, my family and I went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langkawi">Pulau Langkawi </a> for a family vacation. We went to Pulau Langkawi by 
ride a ferry from <a href="https://www.easybook.com/en-my/ferry/terminal/kuala-kedah-jetty">Ferry Kuala Kedah</a>. We arrived at Pulau Langkawi at 10.30 am in 
the morning, since we take the first trip of ferry on that day. After arrived there, we decided to take a breakfast at a restaurant. Then, we decided to continue our day
with going to the one of the major attraction of Langkawi, which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langkawi_Cable_Car">Langkawi Cable Car</a>, which is located at Jalan Telaga Tujuh, 07000,
Langkawi, Kedah. Unfortunately, my family and I did not get the chance to explore each of the stations that they owned, since there is a lot of people there and we want
to avoid the congestion. We decide to just take some photos at the base station of the cable car as a memories.</p>

<p>After finished taking photos, we went to our accodomation that we have booked before went to Pulau Langkawi, which is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VillaSawahLangkawi/">Villa Sawah Langkawi.</a>
All of us agree that we want to spend our night at that villa because we want to celebrate my brother and I birthday. I was so excited since I can celebrate my birthday
with my family members. My family suprised us with a lot of foods such as cake, grilled chicken, grilled lamb and etc.</p>

packages includes with visiting fishing fish farm, eagle watching, bats cave and also crocodile cave. This is my first time experience riding a boat and visiting all the places that mentioned
before. In the evening, we went to Pantai Chenang for taking some photos there and swim at the beach.</p>

<p> Going for a trip with best friends is one of the greatest moments that a person should have in their life. It is because, going a trip with friends can release our
stress especially when we have a lot of assignments and works need to be done. As for me, I went for a half day trip with my friends at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanjung_Dawai">Tanjung Dawai</a> Sungai Petani, Kedah.
We went there on 8 December 2021 around 5:30pm by rented a car. After 30 minutes, we arrived at Tanjung Dawai. Once arrived, we take a walk there and buy some foods. Then, we take some photos together as memories. We also take photos of
sunset because the sunset was so beautiful and we are stunned by the beautiful scenery of Tanjung Dawai.</p>
